# Application Rendering Issues - Fixed

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. **Main Issue: Conflicting App Instances**
- **Problem**: The `src/plugins/global-components.js` file was creating its own Vue app instance and trying to mount it, causing conflicts with the main app in `src/main.js`.
- **Solution**: Converted the global-components file to a proper Vue plugin using the `install(app)` pattern.

### 2. **Missing Dependencies**
- **Problem**: Node modules were not installed.
- **Solution**: Ran `npm install` to install all dependencies.

### 3. **Browser Opening Error**
- **Problem**: Vite was trying to automatically open a browser using `xdg-open` which is not available in this environment.
- **Solution**: Disabled automatic browser opening in `vite.config.js` by setting `open: false`.

### 4. **Path Resolution**
- **Problem**: Some components were using `@/` aliases that weren't properly configured.
- **Solution**: Added proper path alias configuration in `vite.config.js` for the `@` symbol pointing to the `src` directory.

### 5. **Missing Component Registration**
- **Problem**: `RoleSelector` component was referenced in `App.vue` but not registered in the global components.
- **Solution**: Added `RoleSelector` back to the global components registration.

## Files Modified

1. **`src/plugins/global-components.js`**
   - Converted from standalone app creation to Vue plugin format
   - Fixed component import names
   - Added missing component registrations

2. **`vite.config.js`**
   - Added path alias configuration for `@` symbol
   - Disabled automatic browser opening
   - Added proper file URL path resolution

## Application Status

✅ **Development server is now running successfully on http://localhost:3000**
✅ **All components are properly registered**
✅ **Path aliases are working correctly**
✅ **TypeScript composables are functioning**

## Testing Instructions

1. The development server should be running on `http://localhost:3000`
2. You can access the application in a web browser
3. All Vue components should render without errors
4. Navigation between different sections should work
5. The role selector should be functional

## Next Steps

If you encounter any additional issues:
1. Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors
2. Verify all components exist in their expected locations
3. Ensure all imports in component files are correct
4. Check for any missing dependencies in package.json

The application should now render properly with all components loading correctly.
